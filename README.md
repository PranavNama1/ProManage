This repository contains a full-stack web application developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate end-to-end web development skills. The application consists of a visually appealing landing page and a secure admin panel that enables efficient management of projects, clients, contact form submissions, and newsletter subscriptions.

The landing page is designed according to the provided reference layout and dynamically fetches data from the backend. It includes sections such as Our Projects, Happy Clients, a Contact Form, and a Newsletter Subscription section. All user interactions, including form submissions and email subscriptions, are securely stored and managed through the backend.

The admin panel allows authorized administrators to perform complete CRUD operations on project and client data. Admins can add new projects with images, names, and descriptions, manage client information including images, designations, and testimonials, view contact form responses submitted by users, and track all newsletter subscribers in a centralized dashboard.

The application follows clean coding practices with a well-structured frontend and backend architecture. It is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and scalable. Optional image cropping functionality is implemented during image uploads in the admin panel to maintain consistent aspect ratios before storing images in the backend.

Both frontend and backend services are deployed on cloud platforms, and the database is hosted using a free-tier MongoDB Atlas instance. This project showcases practical full-stack development skills, including REST API integration, database management, deployment, and UI/UX design.
